<a class=headline-hash href=#technical-charter-the-charter-for-servo-project-a-series-of-lf-projects-llc><span class="icon hashlink"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></span></a></h1><p><em>Adopted September 16, 2020</em></p><p>This Charter sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for
technical contribution to, and oversight of, the Servo open source
project, which has been established as Servo Project a Series of LF
Projects, LLC (the &ldquo;Project&rdquo;). LF Projects, LLC (&ldquo;LF Projects&rdquo;) is a
Delaware series limited liability company. All contributors (including
committers, maintainers, and other technical positions) and other
participants in the Project (collectively, &ldquo;Collaborators&rdquo;) must comply
with the terms of this Charter.</p><h2 id=1--mission-and-scope-of-the-project>1. Mission and Scope of the Project
<a class=headline-hash href=#1--mission-and-scope-of-the-project><span class="icon hashlink"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></span></a></h2><p>a. The mission of the Project is to provide an independent, modular, embeddable web engine, which allows developers to deliver content and applications using web standards.</p><p>b. The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source project.</p><h2 id=2--technical-steering-committee>2. Technical Steering Committee
<a class=headline-hash href=#2--technical-steering-committee><span class="icon hashlink"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></span></a></h2><p>a. The Technical Steering Committee (the &ldquo;TSC&rdquo;) will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project.</p><p>b. The TSC voting members are initially the Project&rsquo;s Committers. At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be as set forth within the &ldquo;CONTRIBUTING&rdquo; file within the Project&rsquo;s code repository. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.</p><p>c. TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers. The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Unless otherwise documented:</p><blockquote><p>i. Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project;</p><p>ii. Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (&ldquo;commit&rdquo;) source code, documentation or other technical artifacts in a project&rsquo;s repository; and</p><p>iii. A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers.</p></blockquote><p>d. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter.</p><p>e. The TSC may (1) establish work flow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.</p><p>f. The TSC will annually elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC. The TSC Chair, or any other TSC member so designated by the TSC, will serve as the primary communication contact between the Project and the Servo Project Fund of The Linux Foundation.</p><p>g. Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include:</p><blockquote><p>i. coordinating the technical direction of the Project;</p><p>ii. approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project&rsquo;s scope);</p><p>iii. organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects;</p><p>iv. creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements;</p><p>v. appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities;</p><p>vi. establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies;</p><p>vii. approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with the series manager of the Project (as provided for in the Series Agreement, the &ldquo;Series Manager&rdquo;) to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of this Charter;</p><p>viii. discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; and</p><p>ix. coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project.</p></blockquote><h2 id=3--tsc-voting>3. TSC Voting
<a class=headline-hash href=#3--tsc-voting><span class="icon hashlink"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></span></a></h2><p>a.

Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all voting members of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.</p><p>c. Except as provided in Section 7.c. and 8.a, decisions by vote at a meeting require a majority vote of those in attendance, provided quorum is met. Decisions made by electronic vote without a meeting require a majority vote of all voting members of the TSC.</p><p>d.
